                “Solving the world’s most pressing challenges is not just the right thing to do, it is also good
                business.”
                <br><strong style="color: deeppink">Ahmad Ashkar</strong>, CEO of Hult Prize
            </p>
            <p class="reg_text"> The Hult Prize Foundation transforms how young people envision their own possibilities
                as leaders of change in the world around them. With a US$1,000,000 global startup prize as its anchor
                activity, the Hult Prize has brought impact-focused programs, events and trainings to over a million
                students globally, creating a pathway for youth everywhere to take action to build a better world.<br>
                In just over a decade, the foundation has deployed more than $65M into the impact sector which it helped
                create. Operating on more than 2,000 college and university campuses in 121 countries with a global team
                of more than 30,000 staff, student volunteers, and changemakers, the Hult Prize continues to be a

                The Power of One Idea
            </p>
            <p class="reg_text">In 2009 Hult International Business School MBA student Ahmad Ashkar founded a company to
                give his then peers around the world a platform to have sustainable, profitable impact. He later
                convinced Hult’s President, Dr. Stephen Hodges to begin hosting startup events on each of Hult’s five
                global campuses around the world with a focus on the creation of a new kind of business which was
                dubbed,
                “the impact enterprise.” One year, and one meeting with Bertil Hult later, the Hult Prize Foundation was
                born. Today, the Hult Prize is one of the world’s most acclaimed entrepreneurship programs operating on
                more than 1500 university campuses in 121 countries and has become a benchmark startup challenge for
                social entrepreneurship</p>
